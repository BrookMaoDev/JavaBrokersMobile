# JBKR Mobile

JBKR Mobile (Java Brokers Mobile) is a stock trading simulator inspired by Hollywood movies. You know those scenes where stock data in white text is displayed on several black monitors for stock brokers to ignore? ðŸ“‰ We've added a twist! Now, stock brokers can ignore colorful monitors instead of boring black-and-white ones. ðŸŒˆ

## Technologies Used

-   **Java** - The core programming language for the app.
-   [**Yahoo Finance API**](https://github.com/sstrickx/yahoofinance-api) - For pulling real-time stock data from the NYSE and NASDAQ.
-   [**Lanterna**](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna) - For the Text User Interface (TUI) in the desktop version.
-   [**LucidChart**](https://lucid.app) - For UML diagramming.

## Features

### ðŸ“ˆ Stock Data

-   Stock data is pulled in real-time through the Yahoo Finance API from the NYSE and NASDAQ.
-   Stocks can be searched by their ticker name, with the most relevant results being displayed.

### ðŸ˜ƒ Users

-   Users can create profiles with a username and password (encrypted) to save their purchases and balance. User sessions can be managed by logging in and out without resetting upon app restart.
-   A searching algorithm verifies credentials with the database when a user logs in.
-   Users can create either adult or child profiles, with child profiles being restricted to a certain balance and stock purchases.
-   Users can view their portfolio, showing owned stocks, net worth, and net profit gained since the creation of their account.
-   Stocks can be modified directly within the portfolio (e.g., purchase more, sell stocks).
-   Stocks in the portfolio can be sorted alphabetically, by quantity, or by price using insertion sort.

### ðŸ’¸ Transactions

-   Users may deposit and withdraw balance to and from their account, which can be used to purchase stocks.
-   Stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ are available for purchase, with the user specifying the amount they wish to buy.
-   Users can activate a "buy max" function on their owned stocks, which recursively purchases quantities of their owned stocks from most expensive to least until they are no longer able to do so.
